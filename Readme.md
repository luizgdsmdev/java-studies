# Java Studies

Welcome to my Java studies repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my learning journey in Java, from basic concepts to advanced topics, covering the Java ecosystem for backend and frontend development, data structures, algorithms, system design, best practices, frameworks, security, and code optimization.

This repository contains notes, exercises, projects, and resources from various courses I am taking, as well as practical projects I will develop to solidify my learning.

## Repository Objectives

- **Document my progress**: Track my evolution in Java, from fundamentals to advanced topics.
- **Explore the Java ecosystem**: Learn and apply technologies and frameworks for backend (Spring, Hibernate, etc.) and frontend (JavaFX, Thymeleaf, React etc.) development.
- **Master data structures and algorithms**: Implement and study data structures and algorithms in Java to solve complex problems.
- **Apply best practices**: Adopt coding standards, software design principles, and best practices recommended by the Java community.
- **Explore system design**: Understand and design scalable and robust systems with Java.
- **Focus on security**: Learn security practices to develop secure applications.
- **Optimize code**: Study techniques to improve the performance of Java applications.
- **Build practical projects**: Develop projects that integrate the knowledge gained from courses and self-study.
